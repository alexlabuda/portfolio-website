====================================================
1. Core Technologies & Syntax
====================================================
- **Languages**: Primarily TypeScript for strong type definitions, plus JSX/TSX for React components.
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS for utility-based styling; keep raw CSS minimal and use PostCSS for custom processing if needed.
- **Framework**: Next.js for server-side rendering (SSR), API routes, routing, and serverless functions.
- **Libraries**:
  - react & react-dom for UI component rendering
  - tailwindcss for styling
  - postcss for CSS transformations
  - @tailwindcss/typography for better default styling of prose
- **Fonts**: Geist or other imported Google Fonts configured in `_document.tsx` or a global stylesheet.

====================================================
2. Project and File Structure
====================================================
- **Organize** Next.js pages in the `pages/` directory or `app/` (if using the Next.js App Router).
- **Use** `components/` folder for reusable React components.
- **Keep** utility and helper functions in `lib/` or `utils/`.
- **Place** global and Tailwind CSS imports in `styles/globals.css` or an equivalent global file.
- **Configure** Next.js with `next.config.js` or `next.config.ts` for project-wide settings and custom webpack configurations.

====================================================
3. Code Style & Conventions
====================================================
- **TypeScript**:
  - Use strict mode in `tsconfig.json` (e.g., `"strict": true`).
  - Prefer explicit types on function parameters and return values, especially in shared utilities.
  - Enforce no implicit `any` usage.
- **React Components**:
  - Write functional components with Hooks (e.g., `useState`, `useEffect`, `useMemo`).
  - Name components descriptively (e.g., `UserCard`, `DashboardLayout`).
  - Separate logic from rendering logic when possible (custom hooks, utility functions).
- **File Naming**:
  - Use PascalCase for React component files (e.g., `MyComponent.tsx`).
  - Use camelCase for utility or helper files (e.g., `fetchData.ts`).

====================================================
4. Tailwind CSS Usage
====================================================
- **Utility-First Approach**: Leverage Tailwind classes directly in JSX/TSX.
- **Minimal Custom CSS**: Rely on utility classes before adding custom selectors.
- **Theme Config**: Store any extended color palettes, fonts, or spacing in `tailwind.config.js`.
- **Typography**: When using `@tailwindcss/typography`, wrap textual content in `.prose` classes for consistent styling.

====================================================
5. ESLint & Linting
====================================================
- **ESLint**:
  - Configure rules to catch common pitfalls (e.g., unused variables, missing return types).
  - Ensure `eslint-config-next` or `eslint-config-airbnb` (or similar) is properly integrated.
- **Prettier**:
  - Use Prettier for code formatting if desired (optional, but recommended).
  - Configure your `package.json` or `.eslintrc` so that ESLint and Prettier do not conflict (e.g., using `eslint-plugin-prettier`).

====================================================
6. Next.js Features & Best Practices
====================================================
- **Routing**:
  - Leverage dynamic routes `[id].tsx` or nested routes where necessary.
  - Use file-based routing for blog posts, products, or similar resource pages.
- **Data Fetching**:
  - Prefer `getStaticProps` or `getServerSideProps` for SSR or SSG data needs.
  - Use React Query or SWR for client-side fetching if applicable.
- **API Routes**:
  - Place serverless functions in `pages/api/` (or `app/api/` if using App Router).
  - Add proper HTTP method handling and error handling.
- **Server Components (Optional)**:
  - If using the Next.js App Router, leverage Server Components for performance and data fetching if it fits your architecture.

====================================================
7. Performance & Optimization
====================================================
- **Image Optimization**:
  - Use `<Image>` from `next/image` with layout optimizations and custom loaders when needed.
- **Code Splitting**:
  - Rely on Next.js's automatic code splitting by keeping components modular.
- **Bundling**:
  - Monitor bundle size with `next build` and next.js analytics tools.
  - Optimize imports (e.g., import only necessary parts of libraries).
- **Caching**:
  - Use caching headers in API routes when beneficial.
  - Integrate with CDNs or edge networks if hosting large media assets.

====================================================
8. Testing & Debugging
====================================================
- **Unit Testing**:
  - Write tests using Jest and React Testing Library for critical components and utilities.
  - Aim for coverage on all shared utilities and complex logic.
- **Integration/E2E**:
  - Use Cypress or Playwright for end-to-end tests across Next.js pages.
  - Test key user flows (login, signup, form submissions, etc.).
- **Debugging**:
  - Utilize browser DevTools or Node.js inspector for server-side debugging.
  - Provide meaningful error messages/logs.

====================================================
9. Accessibility
====================================================
- **ARIA**:
  - Add `aria-labels` and roles where appropriate for screen readers.
- **Semantic HTML**:
  - Use proper HTML tags (`<section>`, `<main>`, `<nav>`, etc.).
- **Tailwind a11y**:
  - Ensure color contrast meets WCAG guidelines.
  - Provide focus states for interactive elements (`:focus` utilities in Tailwind).

====================================================
10. Deployment & Configuration
====================================================
- **Hosting**:
  - If using Vercel, configure build settings in your Vercel dashboard or `vercel.json`.
  - For other platforms (AWS, DigitalOcean, etc.), ensure environment variables and build commands are set properly.
- **Env Vars**:
  - Store secrets in `.env.local` or secure environment variable managers.
  - Use TypeScript definitions for environment variables if needed.
- **CI/CD**:
  - Configure GitHub Actions or other CI services for automated builds and tests.
  - Run linting, type checks, and tests on push or pull requests.

====================================================
11. Documentation & Maintenance
====================================================
- **Project README**:
  - Provide basic setup instructions (installation, development, build, deployment).
  - List key scripts (e.g., `dev`, `build`, `lint`, `test`) in your `package.json`.
- **Comments**:
  - Use JSDoc or TSDoc for complex functions or shared utilities.
  - Keep comments updated, especially if code references business logic.
- **Version Control**:
  - Maintain descriptive commit messages and use branching strategies (e.g., feature branches, pull requests).
  - Tag releases appropriately if distributing your code.

====================================================
12. Style Guide & Output Expectations
====================================================
- **Style**: Provide clear, maintainable code with typed definitions and minimal inline logic in React components.
- **Output**:
  - Generate functional TypeScript code that follows best practices.
  - Avoid inline styling beyond Tailwind utilities.
  - Provide meaningful error handling in serverless routes or data-fetching functions.
- **Scalability**:
  - Keep architecture modular to accommodate new pages or features easily.
  - Favor composition and reusability in components and hooks.
